<h1>My Favorite Episodes</h1>   
<h2>This is a list of five of my favorite episodes of the 90's classic Are You Afraid of the Dark?</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Tale of Quick Silver</h3>
<p>
A creepy episode with a demonic entity living in the walls of a house.
The look of the ghost that haunts the house is enough to give you chills for years.
</p>

<h3>The Tale of The Midnight Madness</h3>
<p>
A fun a wild ride with the classic vampire Nosferatu. 
Dr. Vink (Aaron Taggart) makes an appearance in this Season Two thriller.
</p>

<h3>The Tale of the Dangerous Soup</h3>
<p>
This episode features a star from a popular movie released two years after this episode aired. 
The concept is scarier than the execution of it; the part that gets me is when one person has a fear of snakes. 
</p>

<h3>The Tale of the Bookish Babysitter</h3>
<p>
 Belinda the Babysitter is creepy af. The cozy setting of this episode also throws you off; you see that you aren't even comfortable in your own home. 
 The witch from the episode is goofy but disturbing enough. The witch's poor dentation is what really offends.    
</p>

<h3>The Tale of Cutter's Treasure</h3>
<p>A classic two-parter that features "Roc (Charles S. Dutton)." 1990s through and through. 
 A wild and fun ride that shows how much brothers mean to each other.
