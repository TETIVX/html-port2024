<h1>More about me.</h1>
<hr>
<P>
    My name is Therman Taylor, and I am a current student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My interests include history, sociology, psychology, and gender studies. In my free time I love to write, watch movies, play video games, and listen to podcasts. Journaling keeps me busy with writing, organizing thoughts, and serves as a convenient form of therapy. Currently, I am dedicating my life to academia, learning about programming languages, and dipping my foot into the world of web development. I am an aspiring psychologist with emphasis on neurodivergence, social psychology, and promoting a healthy self-image. </P>

    My page is entitled “Trichopian Bliss” because of my ongoing bouts with trichotillomania, or the “hair-pulling disease.” The term “disease” would have to be the best way to describe it. While it is manageable, the bouts may intensify and interfere with daily life, physical appearance, and overall psyche. Often time, I ask myself this: “Aye, how I get like this?” I am open about my non neurotypical brain, which adds spice to my life, or at least I think it does? </p>

Other things I deal with
<ul>
    <li>ADHD</li>
    <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>
    <li>PTSD</li>
    <li>Chronic Depression & Anxiety</li>
    <li>Stereotypic movements</li>
    <li>Very real fear of worm-like reptiles...I hate typing the word.</li>
</ul>

    In addition to school and web development, I am an advocate for mental health and social wellbeing. Whenever I can, I love to sit and listen to those and get a feel for their experiences and what drives them. I participate in a therapeutic writing group at the university, which serves as a needed medium for maintaining internal balance. Life’s “Golden Rule” serves as my ideology in addition to always maintaining an open mind.

    Some of my other interests include YouTube Channels [Answer in Progress, “How to ADHD,” Solomonster Sounds Off, Bookstore Besties, Angry Joe’s Reviews, and many more]. As cliché as this sounds, I absolutely love sketch comedy and grunge rock; all decades of rap; alternative; and anything else that I can vibe to. Forgive me for my 90’s moments!

    Making bullet-journals keeps me sane and allows me to outline without thinking of it, as necessary. It is so much easier to let things flow out onto the page for later organization. Recently, I’ve acquired old family photos from my father’s house and going through those has been a time capsule. Generational differences and experiences intrigue me as I relate similarities in groups as opposed to differences. You’d be quite surprised how many young people are just like older people and vice versa.

    My story is still playing out and I am excited to continue the ride.
