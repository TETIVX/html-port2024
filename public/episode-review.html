<h1>Zyuranger Episodic Review</h1>
<h2>The ERNALYSIS</h2>
<h3>Here are some of my favorites from the series</h3>

<p>Super Sentai is an awesome series that serves as the foundation for almost every kid born in the 90's.
Take a stroll down memory lane with some popcorn, maybe a couple of brews, and a couple of hours of free time. 
This is the series that spawned the creation of the Saban Series MMPR in 1993. While I thoroughly enjoyed the American series, I found this series to be better and more dynamic.
